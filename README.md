# RehabEdge
## **Project Description** 

RehabEdge is a mobile and web-based application that supports patients in performing home therapy exercises. Using camera-based AI at the edge, the system checks patient posture in real time and provides corrective feedback. The app also ensures patients stay consistent with reminders, while doctors can monitor progress through a dashboard.

## **Features Planned**

Daily therapy reminders for patients

Camera-based posture correction AI

Doctor’s dashboard with progress history

Secure data storage and sharing

## **User Stories**

 Acceptance: The mobile app sends daily notifications.

As a doctor, I want to see a patient's exercise history so that I can check recovery progress.

Acceptance: A web or mobile dashboard shows weekly score trend.

## ** Tech Stack (proposed)**

Mobile App: Android (Java/Kotlin)

Web App: HTML/CSS/JS (with future React/Node option)

AI Component: Edge AI model for posture detection (future integration)

Database: Cloud or local database for patient/doctor data
