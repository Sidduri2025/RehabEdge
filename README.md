# RehabEdge
## **Project Description** 

RehabEdge is a mobile and web-based application that supports patients in performing home therapy exercises. Using camera-based AI at the edge, the system checks patient posture in real time and provides corrective feedback. The app also ensures patients stay consistent with reminders, while doctors can monitor progress through a dashboard.
