# RehabEdge
## **Project Description** 

RehabEdge is a mobile and web-based application that supports patients in performing home therapy exercises. Using camera-based AI at the edge, the system checks patient posture in real time and provides corrective feedback. The app also ensures patients stay consistent with reminders, while doctors can monitor progress through a dashboard.

## **Features Planned**

Daily therapy reminders for patients

Camera-based posture correction AI

Doctor’s dashboard with progress history

Secure data storage and sharing

## **User Stories**

As a patient, I want reminders so that I do not miss therapy.

 Acceptance: The mobile app sends daily notifications.

As a doctor, I want to see a patient's exercise history so that I can check recovery progress.

Acceptance: A web or mobile dashboard shows weekly score trend.

## ** Tech Stack (proposed)**

Mobile App: Android (Java/Kotlin)

Web App: HTML/CSS/JS (with future React/Node option)

AI Component: Edge AI model for posture detection (future integration)

Database: Cloud or local database for patient/doctor data

Fixed formatting issues in documentation

## Attended Client Meeting and Updated Notes

Participated in client call to gather additional requirements.

Recorded key points and updated project action items.

Shared meeting summary with team for next steps.

Identified potential challenges for upcoming development tasks.

## Limitations

The app prototype has not been implemented yet.

Limited access to real client data for testing.

No integration with external APIs at this stage.

UI/UX designs are still in the planning phase.

## Problems

Uncertainty about exact functional requirements from client.

Difficulty in defining database schema without real data.

Limited team experience with specific technologies.

Time constraints for research and initial planning.

## Constraints

Project scope may change based on client feedback.

Limited testing environment since the app is not developed.

Dependence on team members’ availability for collaborative tasks.

Initial project decisions must rely on assumptions due to missing data.
